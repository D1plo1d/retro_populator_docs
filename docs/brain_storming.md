# RetroPopulator

A pick and place retrofit for 3D printers and CNC machines.


## Motivation

- small production runs are currently very tedious (DIY approach)
- industry need 500 before price becomes reasonable
- graph showing “pain in the ass” vs “boards” with “fuck that” threshold


## Solution

- an affordable Pick & Place for hobbiests
- reliable and automated
- reasonably fast


## The Story so Far...

- Eggbot Driver
- WaterColor Bot Proof of Concept
- PopCAM
- Registration woes!
- First successfull pick + place! (with some failures)
- Plans for the far off world of next weekend


## Now

- Open Source Software and Hardware
- Retrofit for Ultimaker 3D Printers
- Makeable w/ a 3D printer and a laser cutter (for now!)
- Loads from tape
- GCode generation from EagleCAD .brd files
- ~4 seconds per part (double check this w/ video reference!)


## In Progress

- Reusable templates w/ known positions


## Future

- loads from reels
- component rotation
- dedicated machine w/ fast gantry
- GCode generation from KiCAD files
- vacuum control
- advances tape
- paste dispensing
- spring loaded board dispenser
